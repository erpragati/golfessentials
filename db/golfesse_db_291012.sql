OptiFit Weights (12 grams and 2 grams) shift the clubhead&rsquo;scenter of gravity to promote either Draw or Neutral ball flights.</li><li><b>Forged Composite</b>: The revolutionary material in the crown is lighter and stronger than titanium and contains over 7 million turbostratic carbon fibers. This allows Callaway engineers to precisely control thickness, resulting in an optimum center of gravity and high moment of inertia. </li><li><b>Streamlined Surface Technology</b>: Aerodynamic contours reduce energy loss from drag during the downswing by 14% compared to the RAZR Hawk Driver, and create higher impact speeds for added distance. </li><li><b>Speed Frame Face Technology</b>: A combination of VFT and Hyperbolic Face Technology creates a large sweet spot and high ball speeds across the titanium face for long, consistent distance as weight can be redistributed to the perimeter of the clubhead for a high moment of inertia.

The OptiFitHosel allows players to adjust the face angle for improved accuracy and trajectory while the OptiFit Weights can be adjusted to promote either Draw or Neutral ball flights. Golfers can dial in their ideal settings and hit drives like never before with simple adjustability that matters.</p><p><b>Features:</b></p><ul><li><b>OptiFit Technology</b>: The OptiFitHosel adjusts the face angle in Open, Square or Closed positions at address to improve accuracy and trajectory. OptiFit Weights (12 grams and 2 grams) shift the clubhead&rsquo;scenter of gravity to promote either Draw or Neutral ball flights.</li><li><b>Forged Composite</b>: The revolutionary material in the crown is lighter and stronger than titanium and contains over 7 million turbostratic carbon fibers. This allows Callaway engineers to precisely control thickness, resulting in an optimum center of gravity and high moment of inertia. </li><li><b>Streamlined Surface Technology</b>: Aerodynamic contours reduce energy loss from drag during the downswing by 14% compared to the RAZR Hawk Driver, and create higher impact speeds for added distance. </li><li><b>Speed Frame Face Technology</b>: A combination of VFT and Hyperbolic Face Technology creates a large sweet spot and high ball speeds across the titanium face for long, consistent distance as weight can be redistributed to the perimeter of the clubhead for a high moment of inertia. A chemical milling process selectively removes excess material for precision thickness control. </li></ul><p></p><p><b>FAIRWAY WOOD</b></p><p> The <b>Callaway RAZR Fit Fairway Wood </b>is the ultimate in accurate power.
